Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` file for your `angular-node-assignment` project:

---

# Angular-Node Assignment

This project consists of two applications: a client-side application built with Angular to manage transactions and a server-side application using Node.js to handle transaction operations.

## Setup MongoDB

Before running the applications, ensure MongoDB is set up with the following configurations:

- Database Name: `transactions-db`
- Collection Name: `transaction`

You can adjust these settings in your MongoDB configuration as needed.

## Running the Applications

### Client Application (Angular)

1. **Navigate to Client App Directory**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Client Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will compile the Angular application and start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to access the client application.

### Server Application (Node.js)

1. **Navigate to Server App Directory**
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Node.js Server**
   ```bash
   nodemon server
   ```

   The server will start using `nodemon`, which monitors changes to your server-side code and automatically restarts the server as you make changes. By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure MongoDB is running and configured correctly before starting the server application.
- Both applications (`client` and `server`) should be running simultaneously for full functionality.
- Customize MongoDB settings and adjust application configurations (`port numbers`, `database names`, etc.) as per your project requirements.
